<p>It should be obvious to anyone concerned about these politics and the threat they pose to democracy and certain communities, that humanizing their leaders through fun reality TV shows or coverage of their hobbies rather than politics only serves to normalize them.</p>
<p>What is less obvious and yet just as damaging is the hyped coverage of the threat.</p>
</li>
<li>“reactionary democracy. E/li>
<li>
<p>What this points to is that the processes of mainstreaming and normalization of far-right politics have much to do with the mainstream itself, if not more than with the far right. Indeed, there can be no mainstreaming without the mainstream accepting such ideas in its fold. </p>
<p>In this case, the mainstreaming process has involved platforming, hyping and legitimizing far-right ideas while seemingly opposing them and denying responsibility in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This could not have been clearer than when the Guardian launched a lengthy series on “the new populism Ein 2018, headlining its opening editorial with: “Why is populism suddenly all the rage? In 1998, about 300 Guardian articles mentioned populism. In 2016, 2,000 did. What happened? EAt no point did any of the articles in the series reflect upon the simple fact that the decisions of Guardian editors may have played a role in the increased use of the term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My analysis of the titles and abstracts of over 2,500 academic articles in the field over the past five years showed that academics choose to frame their research away from such issues. Instead, we witness either a euphemisation or exceptionalization of far-right politics, through a focus on topics such as elections and immigration rather than the wider structures at play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sitting on the fence is not an option for anyone who plays a role in shaping public discourse. This means self-reflection and self-criticism must be central to our ethos.</p>
<p>We cannot pretend to stand against the far right while referring to its politics as “legitimate concerns. EWe must stand unequivocally by and be in service of every one of the communities at the sharp end of oppression.</p>
