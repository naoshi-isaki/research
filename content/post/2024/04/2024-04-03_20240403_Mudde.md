<blockquote>
<p>As is common in academia, it became a “gold standard” that many scholars now feel compelled to cite when writing on populism. Notably, I once received a revise-and-resubmit decision on a manuscript because I “did not engage enough with the work of Mudde”. As more and more new scholars entered “populism studies”, and as more and more non-populism scholars began to use the term, they started to cite the article purely for the definition.<strong> To be honest, I think many have not really read the article</strong>, and some might not even have seen it, taking the definition and reference from another source. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>My main criterion for sending work off is never, “is it perfect?”, but always, “does it add something to the debate?” And, to be honest, even after 20 years, I re-read the article with a sense of pride, because I think most of the larger and smaller claims in the article have held up well.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the main weakness of the article is, ironically, the claim that there is a “populist zeitgeist”. First and foremost, I never really make it clear and concrete what I mean by the term “populist zeitgeist” – does it mean that everyone is populist now (maximum claim) or that everyone uses populism now (minimum claim). My claim was more towards the minimum, i.e. that the “populist zeitgeist” was mostly discursive (yes, I understand the irony), in the sense I noticed that the broader political debate had become more populist – with populist and non-populist parties using elements of populist rhetoric.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>Of course, there is debate whether the “idea” (of the opposition between “the people” and “the elite”) is primarily an ideology, discourse, style, etc. But these are fairly small differences, which are often almost irrelevant in empirical studies. Is it relevant whether a politician believes or simply uses populism? Not for electoral studies, for example, as voters will not know (or possible even care) whether the politician is ideological or strategical. In fact, although the Laclauian approach is fundamentally different from the ideational approach, it is striking how large the overlap is between scholars of the two approaches in terms of the empirical cases they study. Consequently, several (more) Laclauian scholars have been very influential on my thinking of populism, notably Yannis Stavrakakis.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>And, somewhat related, I am sceptical of the increasing deconstruction of “populism” into three or more “dimensions” (e.g. “pro-people”, “anti-elite”, etc.). As a qualitative scholar, I believe in a holistic approach to complex concepts like populism and that such concepts are more than the sum of the various “dimensions”.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>What I probably find most problematic, however, is that populism is increasingly used to describe one specific form of populism, namely the populist radical right. Even worse, it is often used to describe the far right as a whole, of whom a (growing) part is not even populist. The problem exists in academic, politics, and the media. Starting with the media, populism is often used as a euphemism for far right or racism, as it is less controversial, including to the increasingly powerful far-right parties and their enablers and supporters.<br />Regarding academia, it is a problem to describe the populist radical right as populist, as it is only one of its three core ideological features; the other two being authoritarianism and nativism. Moreover, it is the least important of the three! The core of the far-right ideology, at the very least in Europe and North America (but also India and Israel) is nativism, i.e. a xenophobic form of nationalism – while authoritarianism defines the political approach of the whole far right. Only a subset of the far right is populist, and the more the far right is mainstream, the less populist they become – see, among many other examples, Giorgia Meloni or the Sweden Democrats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If academics would use populism more critically and stringently, I think there would be far fewer studies of populism and we would find that populism is less relevant, let alone transformative, than has been argued recently.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> At the same time, I do believe there is something truly fundamental in the rise of populism in the early 21st century, as I have argued before.</span> In the early 20th century, the radical forces of nationalism and socialism were primarily extremist, i.e. anti-democratic. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today, in the early 21st century, they are primarily populist, i.e. pro-democracy but anti-liberal democracy. That reflects, at the very least, the hegemony of (the idea of) democracy – however people define that concept – and that tells us a lot about contemporary politics.</span></p>

<li>必読のインタビュー。インタビュアーの質問も、気が利いていて良い。痒い所に手が届く感。</li>
<li>なぜここまで多く引用されてきたのか、という自己分析が面白い。</li>
<li>Laclauとの関連も、しばしばseparate tableになっているため、Muddeが語っている点は重要。
<ul>
<li>CanovanがLaclauの通訳を務めたエピソードはかなり面白い。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Canovanらが参照されてこなかったことへのフラストレーションは確かに。</li>
<li>爆発的に増えてきたpopulism研究の問題点を丁寧に指摘している。
<ul>
<li>とりわけ、3 dimentionsに分解すべきではないのでは、という点は興味深い。</li>
<li>PopulismというよりRRなのではと思われる研究が多く、Leftを十分に含めても妥当するのか検証すべきだ、という指摘は首肯。A. Mondonもいつも指摘していることだが。
<ul>
<li>自分が文献を整理するときには、綺麗に区別できないため、苦渋しながらフォルダ名を"Populism_(P)RR"としている。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mudde本人は権威かのように扱われるのは不本意だろうが、少なくとも2004年論文を（表面的に）引用する人々は読むべき。
<ul>
<li>Muddeの自身の扱われ方への思いは、国内でも例えば吉田先生や水島先生も共有するところなのではないか。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>個人的には、2004年論文内でMairを援用してdepoliticizationに言及していた終盤の部分について語ってほしかった。</li>
<li>（Zoteroを確認したら、あまりにも基本文献すぎて、Mendeleyから移していなかった......。）</li>
</ul>
