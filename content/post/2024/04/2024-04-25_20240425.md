<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, despite populist supporters Eapparent contempt for journalists and their work, they tend to consume more news than non-populist citizens. This is true even when we control for other relevant variables like political interest, need for cognition, political orientation, and media scepticism. Furthermore, although populist supporters generally prefer commercial and tabloid news, as well as alternative and partisan media, mainstream news sources remain central in their news media diets.</li>
<li>RQ: How do populist supporters understand and engage with news? </li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Folk Theories - the role of emotion in populist supporters Enews engagement
<ul>
<li>Juarez Miro, C. (2023). “Everything is biased E populist supporters Efolk theories of journalism. The International Journal of Press/Politics, 19401612231197617.<br /><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19401612231197617" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1177/19401612231197617</a>
<ul>
<li>33 interviews with supporters of Donald Trump, Santiago Abascal, Bernie Sanders and Pablo Iglesias</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>'Everything is biased'
<p>Populist supporters believed that news is inherently partisan. In response, they sought the truth by consuming information from diverse sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'It's a way of seeing what other people think'<br />Many participants articulated this folk theory to explain their perception of social media and news as reflecting public opinion, which they found useful for feeling informed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'It's a pleasurable news source'<br />Participants regarded the ideological leanings of news sources and social media platforms Eaffordances as helping to manage their mood while also keeping them informed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>discourse analysis - important role for emotion and (social) identity expressions at the individual and group levels of populist supporters Eengagement with news
<ul>
<li>Juarez Miro, C., &amp; Toff, B. (2023). How right-wing populists engage with cross-cutting news on online message boards: The case of ForoCoches and Vox in Spain. The International Journal of Press/Politics, 28(4), 770-790.
<ul>
<li>Analysing posts referencing the populist party Vox between 2013 and 2019 on Spanish message board ForoCoches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our research revealed that to support their arguments in political conversations, users shared links to both cross-cutting and mainstream news sources.</li>
</ul>
