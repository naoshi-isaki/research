[RQ]

- whether female mayors are more likely to implement gender-sensitive policies than their male counterparts
- whether centre-right Partido Popular (PP) mayors differ from other mayors in their propensity to implement these policies

[方法]

- 接戦回帰不連続設訁E- 市町村間の経年変化に依拠したパネル推定で補完、パラメータを推宁E- 2010年から2014年までの5,000以上�Eスペインの自治体�EチE�Eタを使用</br>
*自治体予算法では、対象となる政策における支出額�E詳細な記録が義務付けられてぁE��

[Findings]

1. we do not detect significant differences by mayoral gender in the propensity that a municipal government engages in gender-sensitive policies. 

2. there are differences in gender-sensitive policies by party: centre-right PP mayors are less likely to preside over local governments that engage in these policies. </br>
= The leader’s gender does not affect their propensity to promote gender-sensitive policies, but their party does. 

-> Why? </br>
Spain is a country with strong parties, in which individual characteristics of local leaders matter less than their party when it comes to policy

- significant differences by party in the propensity to engage with gender-sensitive policies
  - Specifically, mayors from the centre-right PP were less likely than mayors to their left to introduce preschool or long-term care services.
