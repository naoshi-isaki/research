<p>One of the best indications of the mainstreaming and normalization of the far right is the number of journalists who ask me whether far-right party X either (1) is (still) really “far right Eor (2) isn’t really more a “conservative Eparty.</p>
<p>This doesn’t just happen with respect to radicalized conservative parties like Fidesz, GOP ,Likud, PiS. It happens to parties that always were radical right (eg RN or VB) and even to those with extreme right roots (eg FdI and SD).</p>
<p>It happens more often with younger journalists, formed in the 21st century, only vaguely aware of the debates, and mores, of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>It happens with journalists from countries where the far right has been normalized longer (notably Denmark), but is certainly not limited to them. Sometimes even happens with journalists from countries with (crumbling) cordon sanitaire (like a Belgium or France).</p>
<p>To be clear, it is very understandable. In many countries the ideological (or discursive) space between (traditionally) “conservative Eand “far right Eparties has shrunk or virtually disappeared (eg Austria or France or the Netherlands).</p>
<p>Moreover, some of the key tropes of the far right (eg “multiculturalism has failed Eor “immigration is problem/threat E are shared by broad parts of political mainstream (including on the “left E.</p>
<p>Given that the mainstream (right) pretends to be the same, and has (defining) power, it is easier (safer) to assume the far right moderated rather than that the mainstream radicalized.</p>
<p>This not withstanding, most of the academic research argued/shows the opposite: the far right has not “moderated E(at best “modernized E but the mainstream (right) has radicalized.</p>
<p>To be clear, the radicalization of the mainstream is limited to a few issues in terms of policy positions (notably immigration), although broader is terms of discourse (regarding “left Eand “woke Efor instance).</p>
<p>As soon as other issues dominate the political agenda, the far right loses much of its influence  Ethink Great Recession, COVID-19 pandemic, Ukraine War.</p>
<p>To counter the normalization of the far right, a better understanding of the concept/system of “liberal democracy Eis crucial  Eamong citizens, journalists, and politicians.</p>
<p>But I increasingly feel the terminology is a hurdle too: whether “far E “radical Eor “extreme Eright, it all gives the impression that it is defined in relation to the “center E(ie the “mainstream E.</p>
<p>And, because of the radicalization of the “mainstream E(right), the immigration position of the far right is no longer “radically Edifferent from that of the “mainstream E(right) in most countries.</p>
<p>Using the term “populism Edoesn’t help much either, as the normalization has made several far-right parties less populist (eg FdI or SD). </p>
<p>Moreover, populism is a secondary feature for the far right and at least as confusing a term for broader public.</p>
<p>I think the concept of “nativism Eis probably the best, ie most accurate at describing core of (European) far right. But, despite some interesting recent conceptual innovation, the term is little know outside of Anglo academia and doesn’t even exist in most languages.</p>
<p>This is all just to say that the political debate on the far right has changed  Erather than the far right itself  Eand this asks questions of academia that it hasn’t been asked before. Or confronts it with new assumptions and perceptions.</p>
<p>It is important that concepts are neither “stretched E(used too broadly Enor “tightened E(used too narrowly). This requires not just clear terminology but also more informed classifications.</p>
<p>There are very few academic studies of party ideologies. Most parties are classified on the basis of “received wisdom E which includes inertia and prejudice.</p>
<p>While we have more and more cross-national “datasets E they have severe limitations  Emost notably, if there are few people who study party ideology, there’re are few who can classify parties based on ideology.</p>
<p>We also need much more cross-temporal research on party ideology. Have parties changed and, if so, on what issues and how fundamentally? This applies to immigration (and the assumed “nativist turn E but also to economics (and the often declared “neoliberal turn E.</p>
<p>All to say, politics is ever changing and the study of politics (or “political science E if you will) should change with it, if it wants to remain relevant and useful.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean it should adjust its terminology to the mood/mores of the day, but it should take that mood/mores into account to be able to better defend/explain its insights. #TheEnd</p>
