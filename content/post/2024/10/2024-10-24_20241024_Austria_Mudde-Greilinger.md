<blockquote> As such, Austria is a perfect example of the dangerous shortsightedness of normalising far-right parties  Ea process led in the 21st century by, above all, conservative parties.
<p>It started as a way to strengthen its own power, but the ÖVP’s embrace of the FPÁEand the latter’s repeated inclusion in national government helped make far-right policy positions mainstream, which in turn made the far right more acceptable to the general public  Eperhaps ultimately helping it win September’s elections. Because if the mainstream already parrots the far right, then why not just vote for the “real thing Einstead? People prefer the original over the copy, as the far-right French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen once said, and as research confirms.</p>

<p> Given that many conservative parties have by now worked alongside far-right parties at a national or local level, suddenly questioning their competence and abilities rings hollow and hypocritical, and not just to the far right.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the ÖVP’s normalisation of the far right  Elinked to its own radicalisation on certain issues, such as Islam and immigration  Ehas created expectations among its own voters. Today, a substantial share of ÖVP supporters consider the FPÁEto be a better coalition partner than any mainstream party. In a recent poll from before the election, almost half (48%) of ÖVP voters said the party should govern with the “Kickl FPÖ E while just over a third (34%) of ÖVP voters preferred to govern with the “Babler SPÖ E meaning the leader of the Social Democrats, Andreas Babler, and his party.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the ÖVP was the only mainstream party that had not categorically ruled out governing with the FPÁEbefore the election, it did declare its leader, Kickl, persona non grata. While the ÖVP leader, Karl Nehammer, still holds on to this odd separation  Eas though Kickl is somehow exceptional  Ehe is already at odds with almost half of his voters. <span style="
text-decoration: underline;">Moreover, Kickl was the minister for the interior in the previous ÖVP-FPÁEgovernment.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p> This suggests that close collaboration with the far right normalises not only its policy stances but also its behaviour. Given that the ÖVP did little to stop the FPÁEwhen it was the senior party in the coalition, what can we expect of it as the junior partner?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Importantly, Austria is not the only country in western Europe demonstrating this dangerous pattern of far-right normalisation. In both Italy and Sweden, for instance, a far-right party has become the most popular within the rightwing block. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders was normalised to prop up a rightwing coalition led by the conservative People’s party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). When Wilders EFreedom party (PVV) unexpectedly won the election, VVD members forced their party leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz, to enter a PVV-dominated coalition, albeit without Wilders as prime minister. A similar process will likely follow in Austria  Eand it won’t stop there.</p>
