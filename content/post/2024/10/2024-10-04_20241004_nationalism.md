<p>This is a great list of books on nationalism - with one exception. A brief thread on why Imagined Communities is one of the most overrated books in the field - and what other books should replace it on any reading list on the subject. 1/</p>
<p>In my graduate seminar this week we focus on nations and national states. </p>
<p>In addition to rereading three great works from the 1980s (top row), I am engaging with three post-2000 books by the macrosociologist Andreas Wimmer (bottom row).</p>
<p>First, on what I mean by overrated - one way to measure a book's position in the field is its citation count. Eight years ago I compiled a ranking of the most cited books in social science, as measured by Google Scholar (https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/). IC ranked 5th on the list. 2/</p>
<p>This puts it above any book by Bourdieu, Foucault, Marx or Rawls, among many others. But how is it being cited? I don't have data on this but I would hazard ~99% of citations merely refer to the book's title, which is that nations can be described as Imagined Communities. 3/</p>
<p>But very few citations of IC seem to actually engage with the book's real argument, which is that the origins of modern nationalism lie in the development of print capitalism, in particular the rise of newspapers (or “one-day best sellers Eas Anderson calls them). 4/</p>
<p>It is newspapers and novels that allowed people to think of themselves as members of Imagined Communities - along with the role of colonial administrative pilgrimages and what Anderson calls "official nationalism." This is the basic argument of the book. 5/</p>
<p>Yet IC's actual argument has drawn vanishingly little critical 
attention: as White (2004) notes, “rarely has a critical best-seller been so popular and so ignored at the same time E[https://jstor.org/stable/pdf/40068215.pdf], which still remains the case 20 years later. 6/</p>
<p>One partial piece of support for one part of IC's argument comes from Sasaki (2017), who shows that the spread of the printing press is correlated with the publication of dictionaries and language standardization in Europe. [https://cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/publishing-nations-technology-acquisition-and-language-standardization-for-european-ethnic-groups/64CC9AFDA14AA5177455996B70382307] 7/</p>
<p>But largely scholarship has found very mixed evidence for the role of print capitalism. In a 2016 symposium I showed that media coverage in Africa is correlated with less, not more, national identification, or the opposite of what IC would predict [https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67407/1/Imagined%20communities_2016.pdf]. 8/</p>
<p>More recently Pengl et al. (2022) showed that print technology in modern Africa is correlated with greater attachment to ethnic over national 
identities: again, the opposite of IC's argument. [https://cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/cash-crops-print-technologies-and-the-politicization-of-ethnicity-in-africa/847987F47DD0BAB3BE5EC01AF780DE24] 9/</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the problem is IC's over-reliance upon evidence from SE Asia relative to other regions. Anecdotally, I have found those who have the biggest respect for IC to be SE Asian specialists, so my claim for being overrated might lie in its applicability elsewhere. 10/</p>
<p>In any case I remain unconvinced IC deserves its place among the pantheon of nationalism studies. Other books that really deserve to be read more than IC include Rogers Brubaker's Nationalism Reframed (1996), Liah Greenfeld's 
Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (1992), ... 11/</p>
<p>... David Laitin's Nations, States and Violence (2007), Philip Roeder's Where Nation-States Come From (2007), Anthony Smith's Ethnic Origins of Nations (1986) and, most recently, <br />@MayaJTudor<br /> and <br />@hmylonas<br />'s book Varieties of Nationalism (2023). This is only a partial list! 12/</p>
<p>My ultimate point in this thread is not to criticize IC as a bad book per se but to point out that there are high opportunity costs to assigning texts to students in such a crowded field, and we need to get students engaging with the best literature on the subject. 13/13 End</p>

<p>これはナショナリズムに関する素晴らしぁE��のリストである。ただし、E冊を除ぁE��。『想像�E共同体』がこ�E刁E��で最も過大評価されてぁE��本の1つである琁E��につぁE��簡単に説明し、このチE�Eマに関する読書リストで『想像�E共同体』に代わるべき他�E本を紹介する、E/</p>
<p>今週の大学院セミナーでは、国家と国民国家に焦点を当ててぁE��、Ebr />1980年代の偉大な3作品(上段)を�E読するほか、�Eクロ社会学老E�Eアンドレアス・ウィマ�Eによる2000年以降�E3冁E下段)にも取り絁E��でぁE��、Ebr />まず、私が「過大評価されてぁE��」と老E��る理由につぁE��だが、その刁E��における書籍�E位置づけを測る一つの方法として、その引用回数を挙げることができる、E年前、私�EGoogle Scholarで測定した社会科学刁E��で最も引用された書籍�Eランキングを作�Eした�E�Ehttps://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/)�E�、ECはリスト�E5位にランクインした、E/</p>
<p>これは、ブルチE��ー、フーコー、�Eルクス、ロールズなど、数多くの著老E�Eどの著作よりも上位に位置づけられる、Espan style="
color: #d32f2f;">しかし、どのように引用されてぁE��のだろうか？このチE�Eタは持ってぁE��ぁE��、あえて推測するに、引用の99%は単に本のタイトル、すなわち「国家は想像�E共同体として記述できる」とぁE��部刁E��けを引用してぁE��と思われる、E/span>3/</p>
<p><span style="
color: #d32f2f;">しかし、ICの引用のほとんどは、この本の真�E主張、すなわち、近代ナショナリズムの起源�E活字賁E��主義の発展、特に新聞（また�Eアンダーソンが「その日のベストセラー」と呼ぶも�E�E��E台頭にあるとぁE��主張に実際に触れてぁE��ぁE��ぁE��見える、E/span><br />人、E��想像�E共同体�E一員であると老E��ることを可能にしたのは、新聞と小説である。植民地行政巡礼の役割めE��アンダーソンが「official nationalism」と呼ぶも�Eもあった。これが本書の基本皁E��主張である、E/</p>
<p>しかし、ICの実際の主張はほとんど批判皁E��注目を集めてぁE��ぁE��White(2004)が指摘してぁE��ように、「批判皁E��ベストセラーがこれほどまでに人気を博しながら、同時にこれほどまでに無視されることはめったになぁE��[https://jstor.org/stable/pdf/40068215.pdf]。これ�E20年経った今でも変わってぁE��ぁE��E/</p>
<p>ICの主張の一部を裏付ける部刁E��な証拠として、佐、E���E�E017�E��E、印刷機�E普及がヨーロチE��における辞書の出版や言語�E標準化と相関関係にあることを示してぁE��、Ehttps://cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/publishing-nations-technology-acquisition-and-language-standardization-for-european-ethnic-groups/64CC9AFDA14AA5177455996B70382307] 7/</p>
<p><span style="
color: #d32f2f;">しかし、学術研究では、活字賁E��主義の役割につぁE��は非常に相反する証拠が示されてぁE��、E016年のシンポジウムで私�E、アフリカにおけるメチE��ア報道�E、国家への帰属意識を高める�Eではなく、�Eしろ低めることと相関関係にあることを示した。これ�EICの予測とは正反対の結果である</span>[https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67407/1/Imagined%20communities_2016.pdf]、E/</p>
<p>さらに最近では、Pengl et al. (2022) が、現代アフリカにおける印刷技術�E、国家よりも民族への帰属意識と相関関係にあることを示してぁE��。これもまた、ICの主張とは反対である、Ehttps://cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/cash-crops-print-technologies-and-the-politicization-of-ethnicity-in-africa/847987F47DD0BAB3BE5EC01AF780DE24] 9/</p>
<p><span style="
color: #d32f2f;">おそらく問題�E一部は、ICが他�E地域と比輁E��て東南アジアからの証拠に過度に依存してぁE��ことにある。経験則として、ICに最も敬意を払ってぁE��のは東南アジアの専門家であることが�EかってぁE��ため、E��大評価されてぁE��とぁE��私�E主張は、他�E地域への適用可能性にあるのかもしれなぁE��E/span>10/</p>
<p><span style="
color: #d32f2f;">ぁE��れにしても、私�EICがナショナリズム研究の殿堂にふさわしいとは思わなぁE��E/span>ICよりももっと読む価値のある本としては、ロジャーズ・ブルベイカー著『Nationalism Reframed、E1996年)、リア・グリーンフェルド著『
Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity、E1992年)、E1/</p>
<p>チE��チE��・レイチE��ンの『Nations, States and Violence、E2007年)、フィリチE�E・ローダーの『Where Nation-States Come From、E2007年)、アンソニ�E・スミスの『民族が国家を生み出す、E1986年)、そして最も新しいも�Eでは、@MayaJTudorと@hmylonasの著書『Varieties of Nationalism、E2023年)などがある。これ�Eほん�E一部のリストにすぎなぁE12/</p>
<p>こ�EスレチE��における私�E最終的な主張は、ICをそれ�E体悪ぁE��だと批判することではなく、これほどまでに刁E��が混雑してぁE��状況で学生にチE��ストを割り当てることには高い機会費用が伴ぁE��とを指摘することであり、学生にはそ�EチE�Eマに関する最高�E斁E��に触れさせる忁E��があるとぁE��ことだ、E3/13 終わめE/p>
