<p>Many people are sharing this graph, which seemingly shows reasons for why swing voters decided against Harris. Here's a 🧵 on why this tells us very little about actual motivations for vote choice.<br />Method: Swing voters were presented with 4 choice pairs with the statements below.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcBhPHDX0AAnNUM?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="画像" /></p>
<p>They have to chose which one of the reasons they find more compelling. You can then scale this for relative importance.<br />Problem: People usually have one or two important reasons for vote choice. There are many things they don't know or care about. This method thus prompts a lot of responses to things that are likely irrelevant for their actual choice.<br />For example, people see a maximum of 8 reasons. Their main reason(s) might not even be part of their choice pairs. They will evaluate things against each other that are meaningless for their choice.</p>
<p>Hence something that is the number 1 reason for a smaller group but very unimportant for many will show up as less important here than an issue that effectively affected noone's choice but is seen as somewhat important in an abstract sense. Only the former matters for vote shares.</p>
<p>A similar problem arises with reasons that more strongly polarize (e.g. too liberal, too conservative). Both might be highly important for different people. Ultimately, here they show up as not important because choices balance each other out.</p>
<p>In sum, many problems with this method. The results should best be ignored.<br />Original source for this is here:</p>

<p>So true. We also know that most people decide their vote choice ages before an election and then answer these questions with some sort of motivated reasoning. So, the causal relationship is often the other way round, eg. decide to vote for Trump and then motivate that afterwards</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely. The big problem is that the headlines from this will already have affected people's narratives around what has happened. Once they are established, it becomes so difficult to get them out of people's minds.</p>
