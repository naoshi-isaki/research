<p>I am disappointed with mainstream US media, including the New York Times. The headlines are all about Biden’s debate performance. Yes, he’s old. Yes, it would’ve been great to have had a more inspiring younger candidate. Yes, he had a bad night, certainly compared to his State of the Union address. But that is not the main story. The main story is that Trump is a very serious threat to US democracy. </p>
<p>Trump was a threat to US institutions when he was elected in 2016, as I argued then:</p>

<p>We dodged that bullet because civil society mobilized against him, he was generally incompetent, and he did not have competent loyalists around him. It is different now. The threat is much bigger today:</p>

<p>The big story should be stopping Trump. Complacence is dangerous. One form that complacence takes is a blind trust in US institutions  Ethe faulty argument that they are strong and will survive a second Trump term.

<p>As my comment “Yes, it would’ve been great to have a more inspiring younger candidate Ewas meant to convey, the point was not to defend Biden. The point was that whether Biden is the right candidate or not is secondary. The Democratic Party may have made a mistake not challenging his nomination. That’s also secondary.</p>
<p>People who value democracy should vote for any candidate running against Trump. This message is not clearly conveyed by the mainstream media.</p>
<p>The dangers of a second Trump presidency have just multiplied hugely after the horrible decision by the Supreme Court, attempting to create an imperial presidency, in all but name. I am still trying to absorb this decision and its implications (and perhaps I will write something about that once I overcome my shock).</p>
<p>There is also some background to my disappointment about the media. Neil Postman’s wonderful book, originally published in 1985: Amusing Ourselves to Death, presciently outlined the social and political implications of a media ecosystem organized around amusement and and 
entertainment: <br /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X/</a></p>
<p>In a nutshell, if everything in the media is presented as entertainment and in the most sensationalist way, then democratic discourse is impoverished, ultimately making it difficult for democracy to survive. This is what we are seeing today with the emphasis of the mainstream media centered on attention-grabbing headlines, emotive content, entertaining snippets and a search for the most viral content.</p>
<p>We are now living through this more than any time before.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. United States is a true blow to US democratic institutions. In fact, in my opinion this is far worse for US institutions than anything I would have thought possible a decade ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf</a></p>
<p>The ruling is not simply bad because Trump, who has a proven track record of attempting to undermine US institutions, may become president again. It is horrible because it completely removes any constitutional constraints on misbehavior by the president.</p>
<p>It is worth to quote the 
ruling: “the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. E/p>
<p>Although the court says there is no immunity for unofficial acts, this is little consolation. The threat to democracy from authoritarian leaders around the world does not arise because they run over cyclists in their car or misreport their business income in their taxes. From Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey to Duterte in the Philippines Narendra Modi in India and AMLO in Mexico, the threat is presidents Eofficial acts aimed at reducing checks on them, expanding their powers and building fiefdoms.</p>
<p>Some of these authoritarians then go on to spearhead massive corruption schemes, and those are unfair, unjust and corroding. But these leaders Edamage to institutions is much more important than corruption, and even corruption is often in the context of official acts, so the Supreme Court is effectively providing immunity against such corrupt acts as well.</p>
<p>What is the philosophy this ruling is based on? There are two precedents, both of them very flawed. One is articulated by Carl Schmitt, who is famous for justifying Nazi rule wit h his legal theories and philosophy. Schmitt was a brilliant mind but his ideas were deeply fascistic, including the one that could be viewed as a precedent to this ruling.</p>
<p>Schmitt argued in Political Theology that even under the façade of democracy (such as the Weimar Republic during which he was writing), ultimate power rested with the sovereign, and it was a conceit to pretend otherwise, or worse to try to restrict the sovereign’s powers:</p>
<p><a href="https://amazon.com/Political-Theology-Chapters-Concept-Sovereignty/dp/0226738892/" target="_blank">https://amazon.com/Political-Theology-Chapters-Concept-Sovereignty/dp/0226738892/</a></p>
<p>He articulated the idea that politics will always be defined by conflicts, especially between nations, and the sovereign would have to assume extraordinary powers to defend his group, even if there is a pretense of democracy. During exceptional times, which were becoming more likely Schmitt thought, the sovereign would need to take on even more powers. You can see traces of this way of thinking in the Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p>What Posner and Vermeule start from the background painted by the famous book by historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Imperial Presidency, that there is now a powerful administrative state providing a range of public goods, extensive redstribution, welfare, national security and regulation, conferring great responsibility on the executive:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Presidency-Pa-04/dp/0618420010/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Presidency-Pa-04/dp/0618420010/</a> </p>
<p>Schlesinger Jr. saw this as worrying trend leading to the imperial presidency, with excessive powers. Posner and Vermeule argue that this actually justifies an even stronger presidency. If the executive power is going to be essentially unchecked anyway (as Schmitt had put forth), then we might as well get rid of the constraints on the president and make him or her carry out this role unencumbered by roadblocks.</p>
<p>Posner and Vermeule also add the additional argument that the separation of powers doesn’t work anyway, and they even appeal to game theory to make this argument. But their reasoning and use of game theory is flawed as well. The fact that you can go around formal checks introduced by the separation of powers doesn’t mean these are necessarily ineffective. They can work sometimes, and at other times, they may crystallize executive malfeasance, enabling civil society and other power centers to take action.</p>
<p>This is in fact the argument that James Robinson and I made in The Narrow Corridor. Constitutions are no use if there isn’t a mobilized society to stand up against powerful elites and uphold the Constitution to hold politicians responsible:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Corridor-States-Societies-Liberty/dp/0735224382/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Corridor-States-Societies-Liberty/dp/0735224382/</a></p>
<p>But this does not mean that constraints enshrined in the Constitution are not useful. They may be precisely the roadblocks that then enable civil society to become better informed and better organized against abuses of power.</p>
<p>Posner and Vermeule even make now-clearly defunct argument that an imperial president would have reasons to act in a bipartisan, balanced manner because other powerful groups in society will make them do so and as a way of projecting his command more effectively. Difficult to see how anybody could defend this view today.</p>
<p>And of course, the Supreme Court decision is particularly horrible because if Trump comes to power again, there is every likelihood that he will try to we eliminate all constraints against him and undermine institutions that may stand in his way. In the process, he may engage in a variety of unlawful “official acts E</p>
