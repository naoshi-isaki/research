<blockquote>
<p>Seeing a lot of poor takes on #UKElection2024 already, so a quick (completely unasked for) #thread 🧵 before I get my heart broken in the #GERSPA game.</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, this is a HORRIBLE electoral system!!! We might be happy now, because of the outcome, but this is the type of wildly disproportionate system that brought Orbán to a super majority and everything that has happened since.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GRu-kjEbMAAIfVH?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="画僁E width="500" height="322" /></p>
<p>2. Labour has just 10% more votes and 3.5 times more seats?!?!</p>
<p>Not to speak of Reform Party, which is almost as big as AfD but has just 4 seats.</p>
<p>3. Labour has a mandate because it has the seats, that is how the system works -- and worked before for Tories. It is a supermajority and means Starmer can pretty much do what he wants.</p>
<p>4. Just because Reform Party won big, doesn't mean immigration is the key issue of "the people". In many ways, Reform represents a disappointment of nativist voters with Tories and an obsessive focus on immigration by Tories and media (weakly supported by Labour).</p>
<p>5. In other words, immigration wasn't more important then before, nor is it a "spontaneous" issue. It can be made big and it can be made smaller. And it can lead to votes for Tories or for Reform.</p>
<p>6. Hence, there is NO reason for Starmer to center immigration and push for a nativist (lite) course. He has four years to change policies and perceptions as well as lower the salience of immigration (as had happened after Brexit).</p>
<p>7. I still hold some (naive) hope that Starmer will govern more left-wing than he said in his campaign -- just as Biden has in the US. It is not "betrayal", as many progressive voters voted for Labour too.</p>
<p>8. There are virtually NO general lessons to learn from this election. It was highly specific. One party had been in power for almost 15 years, pushing through unique experience of Brexit, going through unprecedented # of leaders/PMs, and scandal after scandal.</p>
<p>9. In this light, 33% of the votes (and just 20% of eligible voters, given 60% turnout), is pretty poor. Also, given the electoral system, which gives Labour tactical advantage over social liberals and greens, whom would be stronger competitors in proportional systems.</p>
<p>10. The idea that Starmer proves that a "moderate" course pays off, is therefore nonsense. There is little reason to assume an openly progressive course (including strong position on Gaza) would not have provided a huge majority.</p>
<p>11. And, again, and this is CRUCIAL, the dynamics in a two-party system are fundamentally different from those in a majoritarian system. Hence, lessons are ALWAYS very problematic.</p>
<p>12. This is all not to piss on Labour's parade or to deny the really important victory for British democracy -- and for marginalized groups and people in the UK. The Tories were awful for democracy, minority rights, the welfare state, etc.</p>
<p>13. But it is fairly basic victory, achieved with an overly cautious and bland campaign, that mostly catered to the right. The super majority is there to truly make difference. I hope Starmer ignores the media, pundits, and party whisperers, and DARES to lead rather than follow.</p>
<p>14. And I hope that progressive parties on "the Continent" do not think they can copy the results of Labour, with whatever campaign, as the systemic differences are just too big. #TheEnd</p>

<p>すでに#UKElection2024に関する稚拙な見解が多く見られるので、EGERSPA戦で忁E��折れる前に、簡単な�E��Eく求められてぁE��ぁE��EスレチE�� 🧵 を、Ebr />1. 何よりもまず、これ�EひどぁE��挙制度だ!!! 今�Eこ�E結果で満足してぁE��かもしれなぁE��、このような乱暴な不均衡な選挙制度がオルバンを趁E��数派に押し上げ、それ以降起こったすべてのことを引き起こしてぁE��のだ、E/p>
<p>2. 労働�Eの得票数はわずぁE0�E�E��、議席数は3.5倍だ?!?!<br />AfDとほぼ同数だが、わずか4議席のReform政党�E言ぁE��でもなぁE��E/p>
<p>3. 労働�Eには議席があるから�EンチE�Eトがあるのであり、それがこ�EシスチE��の仕絁E��だ。これ�E趁E��多数派であり、スターマ�EはめE��たい放題とぁE��ことだ、E/p>
<p>4. Reform党が大勝したからとぁE��て、移民が「国民」�E重要争点であるとは限らなぁE��多くの点で、Reform派は保守�Eに対する排外主義老E�E失望と、E��労働�Eが弱く支援した�E�保守�EとメチE��アによる移民への執拗なこだわりを象徴してぁE��、E/p>
<p>5. 言ぁE��えれば、移民問題�E以前より重要になったわけではなく、「�E然発生的」争点でもなぁE��大きくすることもできるし、小さくすることもできる。そしてそれは保守�Eへの票にも改革派への票にもつながる、E/p>
<p>6. 従って、スターマ�Eが移民を中忁E��据え、E��ライトな�E�排外路線を推し進める琁E��はなぁE��彼には4年間、政策や認識を変えるだけでなく、E��ブレグジチE��後に起こったよぁE���E�移民�E重要性を下げる時間がある、E/p>
<p>7. 私�E、スターマ�Eが選挙戦で語ったよりも左翼皁E��政治を行うのではなぁE��とぁE���E�ナイーブな�E�期征E��抱ぁE��ぁE��。多くの進歩皁E��有権老E��労働�Eに投票したのだから、「裏�Eり」ではなぁE��E/p>
<p>8. こ�E選挙から学ぶべき一般皁E��教訓�E事実上なぁE��非常に特殊だった。ある政党�E15年近く政権にあり、ブレグジチE��とぁE��ユニ�Eクな経験を経て、前例�EなぁE��の持E��老E��首相を経て、スキャンダルに次ぐスキャンダルを経験した、E/p>
<p>9. こ�Eように老E��ると、得票玁E3�E�E��投票玁E0�E�E��らすると有権老E�EわずぁE0�E�E��とぁE��のはかなり低い。また、E��挙制度を老E��ると、労働�Eは比例制ではより強力な競争相手となる社会的リベラルめE���E党に対して戦術的に優位に立つことができる、E/p>
<p>10. スターマ�Eが「穏健」路線�E成果を証明したとぁE��老E��はナンセンスである。�E然と進歩皁E��路線（ガザに関する強ぁE��場を含む�E�をとってぁE��ば、圧倒的多数を得られなかったと老E��る理由はほとんどなぁE��E/p>
<p>11. そして、これもまた重要なことだが、二大政党制における力学は、多数決制における力学とは根本皁E��異なる。したがって、教訓�E常に大きな問題をはらんでぁE��、E/p>
<p>12. これはすべて、労働�Eのパレードに水を差すためでも、英国の民主主義にとって、そして英国の周縁化されたグループや人、E��とって本当に重要な勝利を否定するためでもなぁE��保守�Eは民主主義、�EイノリチE��の権利、福祉国家などにとって最悪だった、E/p>
<p>13. しかし、それ�Eかなり基本皁E��勝利であり、E��度に慎重で当たり障り�EなぁE��ャンペ�Eンで達�Eされたもので、ほとんどが右派に配�Eしたも�Eだった。趁E��数派は真に違いを生み出すために存在するのだ。スターマ�EがメチE��アめE��論家、政党�E囁きを無視し、追随する�Eではなく、あえてリードすることを望む、E/p>
<p>14. そして、E大陸 "の進歩皁E��党が、どのようなキャンペ�Eンであれ、労働�Eの結果を真似できるとは思わなぁE��とを望む、EEnd</p>
