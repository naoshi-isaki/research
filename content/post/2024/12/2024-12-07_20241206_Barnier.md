<p>Isabelle Guinaudeau (@iguinaudeau)<br />The French Parliament has just brought down Michel Barnier’s government via a vote of no confidence  Ea first since 1962. A 🧵 on what is happening, what to expect next - and how the far right is capitalizing on the crisis.</p>
<p>The Barnier government was born out of this summer's legislative elections which delivered no majority. The left bloc claimed legitimacy to form government (being the biggest) but rejected compromises in the name of securing a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>Macron’s bloc had lost but remained pivotal, as this presentation of all winning connected coalitions (by @Ben_Guinaudeau) shows. They could have oriented their negotiations to the left or right.</p>
<p>While the left fundamentally denies the legitimacy of any government not formed by them, the far-right RN did not exclude passively supporting the government, depending on the choice of the PM and substantive policy orientations. This gave them huge leverage.</p>
<p>In this context, Macron chose Barnier over other potential PMs vetoed by Marine Le Pen. But his government could rely neither on support from macronists and right-wing MPs nor on the RN's passive support.</p>
<p>The RN intensified opposition as (1) Le Pen risks ineligibility for misappropriation of public funds and (2) the governments faces the test of the adoption of a budget for 2025.</p>
<p>Their budget faced attacks from all groups and France is  also subject to an excessive deficit procedure and must make huge cuts and/or raise taxes.</p>
<p>RN acted as kingmaker and saboteur. While blocking taxes on electricity and cuts to business subsidies, the RN pressured Barnier on immigration, pensions, and social security cuts. Barnier made concessions, including cutting state medical assistance for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Le Pen took credit from decisions that were actually pushed by other groups (e.g. on pensions, drug reimbursement) and the government's communication helped her to take this credit.</p>
<p>Anticipating that the bill on social security funding would not garner majority support, Barnier tried to bypass Parliament by tying the bill to a confidence vote procedure (49.3): if no vote brings down government, the law is passed.</p>

<p>Anticipating that the bill on social security funding would not garner majority support, Barnier tried to bypass Parliament by tying the bill to a confidence vote procedure (49.3): if no vote brings down government, the law is passed.</p>
<p>This strategy failed, as a majority of MPs just voted in favor of the motion of no confidence tabled by the left. The Barnier government has fallen.</p>
<p>The 2025 budget is now in limbo. There seems to be ways to avoid a shutdown (via ordinances or special laws) but a legislative vote will be needed at some point and France faces a legislative deadlock.</p>
<p>Frustration with politics is peaking (87% of people see the country as in decline, according to IPSOS), trust in institutions eroding and Le Pen's party is likely to capitalize on the sequence.</p>
<p>Macron cannot dissolve Parliament until June. He excludes so far resigning. He could:<br />- Reappoint Barnier<br />- Try to form a "technical" government<br />- Search for a new PM.</p>
<p>Some suggest that Macron might argue the functioning of the State is at stake and use his full powers to pass the 2025 budget before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The current system seems in a deadlock. Proposals for proportional representation could offer a way out and encourage more consensual, less confrontational politics, but the reform is not yet on the agenda.</p>
