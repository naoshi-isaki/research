<p>Critical Junctures</p>
<p>Here’s a brief summary of the contents of the volume I co-edited with David Collier on “Critical Junctures and Historical Legacies” (2022).</p>

<p>Long 🧵</p>
<p>The Tradition in Context 1/2. Critical juncture research is a tradition that was launched by Seymour Lipset and Stein Rokkan in 1967. It is part of a large intellectual movement that embraces historical analysis and seeks to go beyond a focus on short-term causal relations.</p>
<p>The Tradition in Context 2/2. CJ research shares interests with comparative historical analysis, historical institutionalism, the new institutional economics, American Political Development, and historical political economy.</p>
<p>Concept 1/2. Critical junctures are a distinct kind of change that generate a distinct kind of effect. Critical junctures are rapid, discontinuous, macro-level changes. They are not wholly contingent events, unconstrained by antecedent conditions.</p>
<p>Concept 2/2. Critical junctures are changes that create a persistent effect through a self-replicating causal loop. Conceptual issues are addressed in chapters by David Collier, Rachel Beatty Riedl and Kenneth M. Roberts, and Gerardo Munck.</p>
<p>Theory 1/5. David Collier presents a CJ framework using five components: antecedent conditions, cleavage or shock, critical junctures, aftermath, and legacy. This chapter is an update of Ruth Collier and David Collier’s “Shaping the Political Arena,” Chapter 1.<br />David Collier, in Collier &amp; Munck, “Critical Junctures and Historical Legacies” (2022), p. 38.</p>

<p>Theory 2/5. Gerardo Munck revisits the theoretical foundations of CJ research. He shows how CJ research resolves two problems in the study of historical explanations: those of infinite regress and distal, nonrecurring causes. He questions some common views.</p>
<p>Theory 3/5. Munck also addresses how critical junctures themselves are explained in terms of endogenous and exogenous factors, and structure and agency. He underscores the limits of endogenous drivers of change.</p>
<p>Theory 4/5. Rachel Beatty Riedl and Kenneth M. Roberts differentiate between two types of critical juncture: generative, in which contingent choice plays a greater causal role; and activating, in which antecedent conditions play a more important causal role.</p>
<p>Theory 5/6. Riedl and Roberts theorize when different kinds of change—critical junctures, incremental changes, and serial replacements—are more likely. They open an exciting agenda integrating CJ research and studies of incremental change, as studied by Thelen and others.</p>
<p>Methods 1/3. David Waldner challenges qualitative researchers to better address key issues of causal inference. He raises questions about the methodological role assigned to critical junctures as contingent events and holds that process tracing is a partial tool.</p>
<p>Methods 2/3. Waldner shows how key works on critical junctures have not recognized the problem of backdoor paths and suggests how they could do so.<br />Waldner relies on graph theory and discusses well know works using causal graphs such as this one:</p>

Munck provides an assessment of a new literature on quantitative history and highlights its strength and weaknesses.</p>
<p>A key strength: a sharp focus on causal inference and a use of natural experiments.</p>
<p>A key weakness: an inadequate analysis of causal mechanisms. <br />Mainly Substantive Chapters 1/2. The volume has chapters by James A. Robinson, G. John Ikenberry, Sidney Tarrow, Sebastián Mazzuca, Andrew C. Gould, Ruth Berins Collier, Robert Fishman, Danielle N. Lussier, Jody LaPorte, Kenneth Roberts, Samuel Handlin, Scully, Boas, &amp; Kaufman. <br />Mainly Substantive Chapters 2/2. These chapter apply the CJ framework to the study of states, regimes, development, labor incorporation, parties, social movements, neoliberalism &amp; international orders. They exemplify the kind of arguments that are characteristic of CJ research <br />My conclusions 1/3. CJ research is valuable because it (1) addresses big, substantive questions; (2) recognizes that history involves qualitative breaks or discontinuities; (3) is attuned to the temporal dimension of reality; and (4) has an expansive vision of theory. <br />My conclusions 2/3. The potential of CJ research is limited by the following six myths. A critical juncture is (1) a change in an entire system, (2) the only way in which change occurs, and (3) an uncaused cause. <br />My conclusions 3/3. More myths. A critical juncture does produces only (4) institutional legacies, and (5) divergent legacies. (6) CJ research is wedded to one methodological tradition. <br />Resources. Four appendices provide: a list of definitions of critical junctures, a glossary of the key terms used in CJ research, a comprehensive bibliography of research on critical junctures, &amp; brief discussions of 8 books that exemplify CJ research. </p>
