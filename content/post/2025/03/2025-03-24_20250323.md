<p>The myth that “education Ewill defeat populism and strengthen democracy is dangerous and is an internal threat to democratic resilience. We won’t save liberal democracy by placing ourselves on this pedestal of philosopher kings.</p>
<p>Let me explain:<br />1/🧵👇<br />2/ Correlational evidence of education and support for democracy is barely more than evidence that more educated and successful citizens prefer constrained government power to unhinged expropriation.</p>
<p>Yes, there is some evidence you can teach civic values, but… <br />3/ But does this mean that more education in the long run will necessarily lead to more democracy? No. That’s like saying that correlational data from the 19th C. mean that long run economic growth leads to a society of aristocrats averse to redistribution. 🤷‍♂�E� <br />4/ Defeating populism will require democratic liberally minded people (“us E to offer a credible new alternative between the extremes of majoritarian populism (do what the people want no matter the impact on minorities) and technocratic liberalism (do what the “experts Esay). <br />5/ We need to abandon the hubris with which we look at voters who support Trump-like “drain the swamp Eleaders. As we write in , less educated voters in democratic contexts may rationally mistrust experts, leading to waves of anti-expert populism.gratton.org/papers/DrainTh…<br />6/ If you’re more inclined to read a less formal and technical version of our arguments, see<br />Responses to Populism Require Understanding Why Voters Lose Faith in Experts - ProMarketExpert civil servants devise ever more sophisticated policies to tackle emergencies such as climate change. But when voters lose faith in experts, they vote for anti-elite populist leaders who promise…https://www.promarket.org/2023/10/09/responses-to-populism-require-understanding-why-voters-lose-faith-in-experts/<br />7/ The temptation to “constitutionalize Eand “judicialize Epolicymaking, so dear to some fellow liberally-minded citizens, is bound to exacerbate these divisions, leading to populist backlashes that may, in fact, carry large risks of autocratization! <br />8/ We (@edenhofer_jacob and I) formalize this argument in “The rise and fall of technocratic democracies E</p>
<p>gratton.org/papers/Technoc…<br />9/ And the same holds for the temptation to protect democratic institutions via ever stronger checks and balances. While it may slow down autocratization, it may make it more certain! As we argue both with @edenhofer_jacob and with @bartonelee2 in .<br />https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/91/1/340/7059126<br />10/ Our logic may sound theoretically subtle, but it captures a very intuitive 
idea: precisely because of the apparent impossibility of a full autocratic take-over, Trump’s excesses may seem benign to voters who align with some of his policies but still prefer democracy. <br />11/ In fact we also argue and provide evidence for the idea that Congressional gridlock—a consequence of strong checks and balances—may have increased polarization in American politics. See gratton.org/papers/Gridloc…<br />12/ If we are to save liberal democracy from populism, democratic progressive forces in �E�E as well as in �E�E and in �E�E must come up with better and newer visions of a future for democratic societies and abandon the hubris that has characterised them. <br />13/ This “need for new Eis why we called our center a “Lab E Our research is foundational, but we hope it may serve to generate new ideas for a liberal democratic future that includes (rather than scolds) less educated or less successful citizens.</p>
