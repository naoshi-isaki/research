<p>Economist Intelligence UnitのDemocracy Index 2024がリリースされた模様．</p>
<p>これについてPippa Norris氏は，EIUは世界価値観調査WVSやGlobalbarometersのサーヴェイデータを利用しているのに，費用負担は行っておらず，これは搾取だ，と批判．</p>

<p>The <br />@TheEIU<br /> democracy index is one of the most flawed measures of democracy.</p>
<p>These are some of its flaws.👇</p>
<p>My advice: Users beware!</p>

<p>Gerardo L. Munck (@GerardoMunck)<br />I am reviewing global democracy indices and have serious doubts about the value of continuous measures of democracy.</p>
<p>The most modest ones, that solely distinguish between democracy and autocracy, are the only credible ones.</p>
<p>Here are some comments on these democracy indices👇</p>

<p>Disagree, Geraldo. The potential size of errors along the dividing line of dichotomous categories is so much greater than those of continuous measures. Also, the rigor of the construction, concepts, and operationalization matters as much as the type of measures.</p>

<p>Gerardo L. Munck (@GerardoMunck)</p>
<p>Hi Pippa, On the matter of how these supposedly continuous measures are constructed, the problems are really serious: extraneous indicators, indicators that do not involve observables, biases in coding, aggregation based on addition or multiplication of ordinal indicators.  1/3</p>
<p>Another point is the treatment of all regimes as democratic, which implies that a change from say 0.2 to 0.3 on a 0-1 scale is interpreted as democratization. This is what V-Dem does. 2/3</p>
<p>The deeper you dig, the more flaws you discover in these "continuous" measures. So I think we should be more reserved about these measures. 3/3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pippa Norris (@PippaN15)<br />I agree that we should be more reserved about most political indices. But I also have more confidence about coding recent years rather than past years, well-constructed concepts v sloppy concepts, and cases at the extremes rather than in the grey middle zone.</p>
<p>I also do greatly respect the immense amount of work for all such data collection exercises - mega time and effort to do this well for minimal academic glory. Its the users who need more care.</p>
<p>Also, v. impt, there is no universe of experts, of course, so no sort of "sample" can be constructed for any "expert surveys"...</p>
