<p>Many in UK media argue that Reform cannot be grouped with other European radical right parties as their positions are not comparable. As a result we see terminology like "hard right". In the new CHES on the left-right scale, authoritarianism, immigration, anti-elitism you can see this is wrong 1/</p>
<p>Reform clearly clusters with prototypical radical right parties such as the FPÖ and the AfD. Hence, UK media should use the appropriate terminology of radical right or far right. Otherwise, euphemisms like "hard right" risk further normalizing Reform. 2/</p>
<p>The CHES is a survey of national party experts to place parties on political dimensions. It is generally considered the gold standard of comparative party research.<br />The new data has just come you. You can check it out with the link below. Big thank you to the team!</p>
